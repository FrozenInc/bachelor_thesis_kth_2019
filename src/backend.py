# this is a new file that simulates the world
# it should create the world in here with all the required matricies and obejcts
# it should try to run as fast as possible(below 60 fps as we dont want it to speed infront of the frontend)
# it should send all the current data to both the fronend and the log so that it can be displayed and saved

import frontend

# TODO: be able to create a world from world.py
# TODO: be able to create the right objects with the right maximizers
# TODO: be able to calculate a tick, update all required things and send the new data to fronend en log
# data needed to be send to frontend:
# 1. current states of the objects
# 2. planned states of the objects (their planned trajectories)
