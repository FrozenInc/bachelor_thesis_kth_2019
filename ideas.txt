make it so that the leader optimizes first and then sends the optimized trajectory to the follower, who will optimize over just the current leader trajectory


what to do:
- optimize the dynamics, from elis kod and whiteboard
- zero friction
- try with other speed for the cars and/or different starting locations, maybe get a better results?
- find why the red car doesnt respond faster to the obstacle
